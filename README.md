# Detecting_CVDs_ECG
Classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals plays an important role in the diagnosis of heart diseases. In this paper, we offered a computerized Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Classification of Atrial Fibrillation, Ventricular Fibrillation, and Normal. The proposed model was trained and tested on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. ECG recording of 26 datasets of patients with paroxysmal or sustained atrial and ventricular fibrillation. For the preprocessing the signal had to go through multiple noise removal techniques like moving average filter, simple low pass FIR filter, Butterworth high pass filter, and low pass Butterworth filter. The ANN model is fed with the 30,450 training examples and validated across 6,525 examples and then tested with 6,525 examples with an accuracy of 0.99%.
